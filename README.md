# Sample Code Assignment

## Problem Statement
See ./data/README.md

## Installation
- Install python3
- Create a virtual env using pipenv
- Download repository from github
- Install packages in Pipfile . I use `pipenv install`

## Explore
My development of the program was first done in Jupyter. The included notebook **slcsp.ipynb** is useful to debug the solution, especially when reviewing specific cases.

## Test
`pytest`

## Run program
`python slcsp.py -s data/slcsp.csv -p data/plans.csv 
-z data/zips.csv`
